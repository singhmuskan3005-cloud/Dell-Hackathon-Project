## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview

**Product Name:** HackOS — AI-Enabled Hackathon Management Platform  
**Problem Statement:** Hackathon organizers waste 20–30 hours per event on fragmented coordination across 5–7 tools. Evaluation processes carry undisclosed bias, participants experience communication gaps, and manual processes collapse beyond 50 participants.

**Solution:** A unified, role-based 3-day MVP that automates the highest-value hackathon workflows using measurable AI components: intelligent registration deduplication, FaceScan personhood validation, skill-vector-based team formation, expertise-matched reviewer assignment, statistically rigorous bias detection, Promotion AI, and a tamper-evident audit trail.

**Core Differentiators:**
- **Resume Auto-Fill**: Participants upload resume, Gemini auto-fills the entire registration form.
- Multi-signal duplicate detection with explainable similarity breakdown (not just email check)
- FaceScan true-person validation using consented liveness checks, not cross-user face matching
- Hungarian-algorithm-optimized reviewer assignment with live cost comparison vs. naive round-robin
- Statistical bias detection (Mann-Whitney U, z-score, inter-reviewer reliability) with confidence intervals — not threshold rules
- SHA-256 hash chain audit log with real-time chain integrity verification
- **Gamified Leaderboards**: Real-time evaluation countdowns and reviewer consistency ranks.
- Skill-vector coverage optimization for team formation

**Tech Stack:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind (frontend), FastAPI + Python (backend), PostgreSQL + pgvector (data), sentence-transformers + Gemini Flash (AI), MediaPipe/OpenCV for local liveness validation, Redis (caching/queuing), WebSockets (real-time).

## 2. Problem Analysis

### 2.1 Root Cause Analysis of Hackathon Failures

| Pain Point (PDF) | Root Cause | AI Solution Mapped |
|---|---|---|
| Fragmented tools (5–7) | No unified data model | Single platform with event-scoped data graph |
| 20–30 hr organizer overhead | Manual coordination at every stage | Automated workflows with human-in-the-loop only at exception points |
| 35% fairness concerns | Subjective reviewer selection + unchecked score variance | Multi-objective assignment + statistical bias monitoring |
| 50% communication gaps | Batch, uncontextualized notifications | RAG chatbot + event-triggered personalized alerts |
| Collapse beyond 50 participants | O(n²) manual matching processes | Algorithmic assignment with O(n log n) complexity |

### 2.2 What the Problem Statement Actually Rewards

Reading the judging criteria (§8.2) carefully reveals the scoring hierarchy:

- **"AI implementation accuracy and effectiveness"** — judges will ask for numbers. Every AI component must have a measurable metric attached, demonstrated live, not claimed.
- **"Innovation and uniqueness of AI implementations"** — the bias detection approach is the highest-differentiation component because it uses real statistics (Mann-Whitney U, confidence intervals) rather than threshold rules, which almost no competitor will implement.
- **"Workflow coherence"** — the entire hackathon lifecycle must feel like one system, not seven disconnected features.
- **"Comprehensive audit trails"** — explicitly listed. The hash chain must be real and verifiable on demand.

## 4. User Personas

### 4.1 Hackathon Organizer / Admin

**Name:** Priya — VIT Technical Fest Coordinator  
**Goals:** Run a 500-participant hackathon with 3 organizing committee members. Needs to reduce coordination overhead, ensure evaluation is defensible to participants, and produce post-event analytics for institutional reporting.  
**Pain Points:** Currently uses Google Forms + WhatsApp groups + Excel sheets. Spent 18 hours on the last hackathon managing reviewer conflicts manually. Two teams complained about biased evaluation — couldn't prove otherwise.  
**Success Metric:** Can configure and launch a hackathon in under 30 minutes. Can generate a bias-free evaluation report after results.  
**Technical Comfort:** Moderate. Can understand dashboards but won't read algorithm details.

### 4.2 Participant

**Name:** Arjun — Third-year CSE student  
**Goals:** Register, find teammates with complementary skills, submit project, get fair evaluation and meaningful feedback.  
**Pain Points:** "I missed the announcement about the submission deadline because it was buried in a Discord thread."  
**Success Metric:** Registration takes under 5 minutes. Gets notified about deadlines through the platform. Receives specific feedback on why his team didn't win.  
**Technical Comfort:** High. Will test edge cases and try to game the system.

### 4.3 Reviewer / Judge

**Name:** Dr. Anita — Industry professional, AI domain expertise  
**Goals:** Evaluate 8–12 projects in her domain fairly and efficiently. Avoid conflicts of interest without manually tracking them.  
**Pain Points:** In past hackathons, was assigned to review a project by her own former intern without being notified of the conflict. Has no standardized rubric.  
**Success Metric:** Receives only projects in her domain. Conflict check happens automatically. Rubric is clear and consistent.  
**Technical Comfort:** High. Will notice if the bias detection methodology is statistically sound or fabricated.

### 4.4 Mentor

**Name:** Rahul — Senior SDE at a product company  
**Goals:** Provide timely guidance to teams that match his expertise. Avoid being overwhelmed by too many requests.  
**Pain Points:** In past hackathons, got pinged by 20+ teams even though he only knows backend systems.  
**Success Metric:** Only matched to teams working on relevant problem statements. Can see which teams haven't had mentor contact and proactively reach out.

### 8.2 AI Component Selection Rationale

| Component | Choice | Why | Alternative Considered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text embeddings | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (local) | 384-dim, 80ms/call, no API cost, runs on CPU | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small: good but costs money + network latency |
| Skill extraction | Gemini Flash | Structured JSON output, understands domain context better than classification | spaCy NER: faster but needs domain fine-tuning |
| Assignment optimizer | scipy `linear_sum_assignment` | Hungarian algorithm, exact O(n³), handles constraint weights | Google OR-Tools: more powerful but heavier setup for a 3-day MVP |
| Bias statistics | scipy.stats (mannwhitneyu, kruskal, zscore) | Non-parametric, correct for small samples, no normality assumption | t-test: wrong for ordinal score data |
| NLG feedback | Gemini Flash | Contextual, personalized output from score data | Template-based: faster but less impressive in demo |
| Chatbot retrieval | pgvector + sentence-transformers | Same model as registration, single stack | Pinecone: managed but adds external dependency |
| Fuzzy matching | RapidFuzz (Jaro-Winkler) | Fast, handles transliterations well (e.g., Arjun vs. Arjun Kumar) | difflib: slower, less robust to transliterations |

## 9. Registration Intelligence Architecture

### 9.1 Architecture Overview

The registration pipeline is a multi-stage async processor. The synchronous API handler validates input, persists the raw registration, and enqueues a Celery task. The client subscribes to a WebSocket channel keyed by job_id to receive real-time stage updates.

#### 9.2 Duplicate Detection Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Exact Matching (< 10ms)

- Email exact match → immediate flag as duplicate; no further processing

- Phone hash match → immediate flag

- GitHub username exact match → high duplicate signal added

#### Stage 2: Fuzzy Name + College Matching (< 50ms)

```text
name_sim = RapidFuzz.token_sort_ratio(name_a.lower(), name_b.lower()) / 100
college_sim = RapidFuzz.token_sort_ratio(normalize_college(c_a), normalize_college(c_b)) / 100
# College normalization: lowercase, expand abbreviations (IIT->indian institute of technology)
```

#### Stage 3: Semantic Embedding Similarity (< 2s)

```text
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # 384-dim
resume_emb   = model.encode(gemini_parsed_resume_text)  # Gemini extracts clean text from PDF
skills_emb   = model.encode(participant.skills_text)
github_emb   = model.encode(fetch_github_summary(participant.github_url))
# github_summary: top repos, languages, pinned description — GitHub REST API

resume_sim  = cosine_similarity(resume_emb_a,  resume_emb_b)
skills_sim  = cosine_similarity(skills_emb_a,  skills_emb_b)
github_sim  = cosine_similarity(github_emb_a,  github_emb_b)
```

#### Stage 4: FaceScan Personhood Validation (Optional, < 3s if consented)

```text
# FaceScan is NOT duplicate detection and NOT identity matching.
# Goal: validate that the registrant appears to be a real live person.

person_validation = run_liveness_check(
  checks=['face_present', 'blink_detected', 'head_turn_detected'],
  max_duration_seconds=8
)

if person_validation.score >= 0.75:
    person_validation_status = 'verified'
elif consent_declined or camera_unavailable:
    person_validation_status = 'manual_review'
else:
    person_validation_status = 'review_required'

# Raw frames are deleted immediately after validation.
# Store only status, score, consent timestamp, and audit metadata.
```

#### Stage 5: Weighted Score Computation

```text
W = {'resume':0.35, 'skills':0.25, 'github':0.20, 'name':0.12, 'college':0.08}
score = sum(W[k]*sim[k] for k in W)

# Device/IP bonus signals (additive):
if device_fingerprint matches: score += 0.15
if ip_matches_within_24h:     score += 0.10
score = min(score, 1.0)  # cap at 1.0

# FaceScan is intentionally not included in this score.
```

#### Stage 6: Threshold + Decision

|Score Range|Decision|Action|
|---|---|---|
|0.00 – 0.69|ACCEPT|Auto-approve; store embeddings; send confirmation|
|0.70 – 0.84|MANUAL REVIEW|Flag with similarity explanation; admin must review within 24h|
|0.85+|POTENTIAL DUPLICATE|Block registration; show which existing registration matched and why|
|Any: exact email/phone match|HARD DUPLICATE|Immediate block; no further processing|

#### 9.3 Similarity Explanation

When a registration is flagged, the admin dashboard shows a breakdown card: similarity score per dimension (as a bar chart), matching registration profile (anonymized), device/IP signals, and a recommended action (Approve / Reject / Request Clarification from participant).

#### 9.4 Privacy-Preserving AI Design

- Sensitive fields (email, phone, name) stored in PostgreSQL encrypted at rest (AES-256); never sent directly to Gemini

- Gemini receives: resume text content only (no PII); skills description; GitHub public data

- FaceScan validation stores no cross-user embeddings. Raw frames are deleted after validation; only status, score, consent timestamp, and optional salted capture hash are retained for audit.

- Audit log records every duplicate check decision with actor, timestamp, and score breakdown

- GDPR right-to-erasure: endpoint deletes embeddings, FaceScan metadata, PII fields nulled, registration anonymized

> CRITICAL: FaceScan requires explicit opt-in consent with clear purpose explanation at registration time. Implement a "Delete My FaceScan Data" action in participant settings. If consent is declined, use manual organizer review instead of blocking registration.

## 10. Team Formation Architecture

### 10.1 Skill Vector Generation

Each approved participant is processed by Gemini to extract a 10-dimension normalized skill vector. This vector is used for team formation, reviewer matching, and unified embedding generation.

```text
GEMINI_PROMPT = '''
You are a technical skills classifier. Given a participant's resume and skills description,
output ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact keys. Values must be floats 0.0-1.0.
Keys: backend, frontend, ai_ml, design, cloud, security, mobile, data_engineering, devops, product
Base values on demonstrated experience, not aspirations. Cap at 0.9 unless expert-level evidence.
Output only JSON, no markdown, no explanation.
INPUT: {resume_text}
SKILLS: {skills_description}
'''
```

Post-processing: normalize so max(vector) = 1.0; clip all values to [0.0, 1.0]. Store as float[] in PostgreSQL skill_vectors table.

### 10.2 Coverage Scoring Model

The admin defines a required coverage specification per problem statement: the minimum skill level needed for the team to be considered well-formed.

```text
required_coverage = {
  'ai_ml': 0.70, 'backend': 0.60, 'frontend': 0.50, 'cloud': 0.40, 'design': 0.40
}

def team_vector(members):
    return {skill: max(m.skills[skill] for m in members) for skill in all_skills}

def coverage_score(members, required):
    tv = team_vector(members)
    total_weight = sum(required.values())
    score = sum(min(tv[s], req) / req * req for s, req in required.items())
    return score / total_weight  # 0.0 to 1.0
```

### 10.3 Algorithm Selection Analysis

|Algorithm|Time Complexity|Optimal?|Recommendation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Greedy (skill gap fill)|O(n * k * m)|No (local optima)|Good for n>500; fast; use as fallback|
|Bipartite Matching|O(V * E)|Yes for 1-to-1|Suitable for simple skill requirements|
|Hungarian Algorithm|O(n^3)|Yes for assignment|RECOMMENDED for n<200; scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment|
|ILP / Constraint Optimization|NP-hard (practical: minutes)|Yes for complex constraints|Overkill for hackathon scale; adds dependency weight|

> NOTE: Use modified greedy for initial team formation (fast, explainable). Run Hungarian algorithm optimization as a secondary pass for final team quality improvement. ILP is overengineered for this use case.

### 10.4 Formation Algorithm (3-Hour Auto-Formation)

1. Query all approved, teamless participants for the hackathon

1. Group by preferred problem statement

1. For each PS with incomplete teams: compute coverage gap = required_coverage - current_team_vector

1. Score each unassigned participant by: gap_fill_score = dot(gap, participant.skill_vector) / norm(gap)

1. Assign participant with highest gap_fill_score to team; recalculate coverage; repeat

1. If team complete (coverage >= 0.85) or max_size reached: finalize team

1. Remaining unassigned participants: form balanced teams by minimizing skill vector variance

1. Generate diversity_score = entropy(skill_distribution_in_team) for each team

1. Notify all participants of team assignment via WebSocket + email

### 10.5 Unified Participant Embedding

A single 384-dim embedding is generated per participant for reuse across team formation, duplicate detection, and reviewer matching. This avoids redundant computation.

```text
unified_emb = model.encode(
  f'{resume_text} [SEP] {skills_text} [SEP] {github_summary} [SEP] {interests} [SEP] {preferred_ps}'
)
# Stored in pgvector table: participant_embeddings(user_id, hackathon_id, embedding vector(384))
```

## 11. Reviewer Intelligence Architecture

### 11.1 Expertise Matching

Project descriptions and reviewer expertise profiles are both embedded using the same SentenceTransformer model. Cosine similarity forms the base expertise match score.

```text
project_emb  = model.encode(f'{title} {description} {tech_stack}')
reviewer_emb = model.encode(f'{expertise_domains} {bio} {past_work}')
expertise_sim = cosine_similarity(project_emb, reviewer_emb)
```

### 11.2 Multi-Objective Cost Matrix

```text
cost[i][j] = 1 - match_score(reviewer_i, project_j)

match_score = (
  0.40 * expertise_sim(i, j)
+ 0.30 * (1 - workload_penalty(i))   # penalty rises as assignments increase
+ 0.20 * (1 - conflict_flag(i, j))   # 0 = conflict, 1 = no conflict
+ 0.10 * diversity_bonus(i, j)         # reward assigning diverse domain pairs
)
```

### 11.3 Conflict Detection Logic

- Same organizational affiliation (college/company): conflict_score = 1.0 — reviewer cannot review their own institution

- Shared IP subnet (same /24 network): conflict_score = 0.7 — potential cohabitation

- Prior mentor-mentee relationship in same hackathon: conflict_score = 0.5

- GitHub collaborators (co-committed repositories): conflict_score = 0.3

- If any conflict signal detected: cost[i][j] = 1.0 (effectively excluded from assignment)

### 11.4 Assignment Algorithm

```text
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment
row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)
# O(n^3) — for n=100 projects, 20 reviewers: ~50ms
# For n=500: ~6 seconds — run as async Celery task

# Load balancing constraint:
max_per_reviewer = ceil(len(projects) / len(reviewers)) * 1.1
# If any reviewer exceeds limit: re-assign overflow to next-best reviewer
```

### 11.5 Dynamic Reassignment

- Celery beat checks reviewer submission status every 30 minutes during evaluation window

- If reviewer misses T-6h warning: admin alerted with suggested reassignment

- If reviewer misses T-0 (deadline): system auto-reassigns to reviewer with lowest current load and best domain match

- Reassignment triggers WebSocket notification to affected reviewer and admin

### 11.6 Workload Variance Guarantee

```text
target = len(projects) / len(reviewers)
for each reviewer r:
    assert abs(assigned_count[r] - target) / target <= 0.10  # +/-10% variance
# If violation detected: swap lowest-priority assignment between over/under-loaded reviewers
```

## 12. Bias Detection Architecture

### 12.1 Reviewer-Level Outlier Detection

Triggered on every evaluation score submission. Detects reviewers who are consistently lenient or harsh relative to the peer group.

```text
reviewer_scores = [all scores submitted by reviewer_r]
all_reviewer_means = [mean(scores) for each reviewer]
z_score = (mean(reviewer_scores) - mean(all_reviewer_means)) / std(all_reviewer_means)
if abs(z_score) > 2.0:
    create_bias_alert(type='REVIEWER_OUTLIER', severity='WARNING', reviewer=r)
```

### 12.2 Demographic Bias Tests

> NOTE: Demographic bias tests require demographic data fields in registration. These fields must be strictly optional and GDPR-compliant with explicit consent. Without demographic data, the system skips these tests and logs 'insufficient demographic data'.

|Bias Dimension|Statistical Test|Trigger Threshold|Alert Severity|
|---|---|---|---|
|Gender bias|Mann-Whitney U test|p < 0.10|WARNING; p < 0.05: ALERT|
|Geographic bias|Kruskal-Wallis H test|p < 0.10|WARNING; p < 0.05: ALERT|
|Institutional bias|One-way ANOVA + Tukey HSD|p < 0.10|WARNING; p < 0.05: ALERT|
|Technology stack bias|Score comparison by primary tech tag|Effect size d > 0.3|WARNING; d > 0.5: ALERT|
|Temporal drift|Spearman correlation: score vs eval sequence|\|rho\| > 0.4|WARNING: reviewer fatigue signal|
|Criterion inconsistency|CV (coeff of variation) per criterion|CV > 0.5 for one reviewer|WARNING: review criteria misunderstood|

### 12.3 Score Normalization Pipeline

```text
# Per-reviewer Z-score normalization
normalized[r][p] = (raw[r][p] - mean(raw[r])) / std(raw[r])

# Global rescaling (bring back to original score range)
final_normalized[r][p] = normalized[r][p] * global_std + global_mean

# Aggregate across reviewers (weighted by reliability score)
reliability[r] = 1 / (1 + consistency_penalty[r])  # lower penalty = higher reliability
final_score[p] = weighted_mean(final_normalized[:, p], weights=reliability)
```

### 12.4 Bias Alert Workflow

1. Alert created with: reviewer_id, alert_type, severity, statistical_detail, affected_projects

1. Admin sees alert in dashboard: severity badge + explanation + affected submissions highlighted

1. Admin actions: Acknowledge Only / Trigger Re-normalization / Request Re-evaluation from different reviewer

1. All admin actions logged in audit trail

1. Fairness score = 1 - max(normalized_effect_size across all detected biases) — shown on dashboard

## 13. Communication AI Architecture

### 13.1 System Architecture

The communication system combines a RAG-powered chatbot for synchronous Q&A, a Celery-based scheduler for proactive notifications, and a WebSocket layer for real-time delivery.

#### RAG Pipeline

1. Knowledge base ingestion: hackathon config + FAQ document + problem statement details are chunked (512 tokens, 50-token overlap), embedded, and stored in pgvector knowledge_base table

1. User message arrives via WebSocket: embed query using same model

1. pgvector cosine similarity search: retrieve top-5 most relevant chunks

1. Inject user context: registration status, team membership, submission status

1. Construct Gemini prompt: system_prompt + contexts + user_context + conversation_history (last 10 turns) + user_message

1. Gemini streams response token-by-token → WebSocket sends chunks to client for real-time display

1. Store full exchange in chat_messages table; update session context

#### Proactive Notification Scheduler

```text
# Celery beat schedule (runs every 15 minutes)
@celery.task
def check_deadline_reminders():
    for hackathon in active_hackathons:
        for deadline in [submission, evaluation, team_formation]:
            delta = deadline - now()
            if delta in [48h, 24h, 2h]:
                users = get_users_without_completion(hackathon, deadline.type)
                for user in users:
                    send_personalized_reminder(user, deadline, hackathon)
```

#### Personalization Logic

- Reminder content varies by user journey stage: 'Your team hasn't submitted yet — you have 2 hours!' vs 'Great submission! Stay tuned for results.'

- Tone adapted based on previous engagement: frequent chatbot users get conversational tone; others get formal email

- Multilingual: Gemini translates reminder content to participant's detected preferred language (from chat history)

### 13.2 Chatbot Fallback Strategy

- If pgvector search returns max similarity < 0.60: mark response as low-confidence

- Low-confidence responses include: 'I am not sure about this — I have flagged this question for your organizer'

- Organizer receives notification with unanswered question; can respond directly and optionally add to knowledge base

## 14. Results Engine Design

### 14.1 Results Computation Pipeline

1. Trigger: admin clicks 'Compute Results' or auto-trigger when all evaluations submitted

1. Collect all evaluations for the hackathon; validate completeness

1. Per-reviewer Z-score normalization (see Section 12.3)

1. Weighted aggregation by criteria weights defined by admin

1. Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 resamples, 95% CI) per team

1. Sort teams by final_score descending

1. Apply tie-breaking cascade if scores within CI overlap

1. Trigger Gemini feedback generation for all teams (async batch)

1. Trigger announcement content generation

1. Publish results: update hackathon status, notify all participants

### 14.2 Tie-Breaking Cascade

|Level|Criterion|Implementation|
|---|---|---|
|1|Primary evaluation criterion score|Compare raw score on highest-weight criterion|
|2|Secondary evaluation criterion score|Compare raw score on second-highest-weight criterion|
|3|Submission timestamp|Earlier submission wins (rewards preparedness)|
|4|Admin manual override|Admin can set explicit rank override with logged justification|

### 14.3 Personalized Feedback Generation

```text
FEEDBACK_PROMPT = '''
You are a supportive hackathon evaluator generating feedback for a student team.
Team: {team_name} | Problem Statement: {ps_title}
Scores by criterion: {score_breakdown}
Reviewer comments: {aggregated_comments}
Generate 3-4 paragraphs of encouraging, constructive feedback.
Paragraph 1: Overall performance summary
Paragraph 2: Strongest aspects with specific evidence
Paragraph 3: Areas for improvement with actionable suggestions
Paragraph 4: Encouragement and next steps
Tone: professional but warm. Avoid generic phrases like 'good effort'.
'''
```

### 14.4 Confidence Scoring

Teams whose bootstrap CI upper bound exceeds the next team's lower bound are considered statistically distinct in ranking. Teams within CI overlap are flagged for admin review before announcement.

```text
final_score = mean(bootstrap_samples)
ci_lower, ci_upper = np.percentile(bootstrap_samples, [2.5, 97.5])
confidence = (ci_upper - ci_lower) / final_score  # lower = higher confidence
```

## 18. Service Architecture

### 18.1 Service Decomposition

The system is designed as a modular monolith (for 3-day development feasibility) with clear service boundaries that allow extraction into true microservices for production scaling. Each module is a FastAPI router with its own business logic layer.

|Service Module|Responsibilities|External Dependencies|Scaling Trigger|
|---|---|---|---|
|Auth Service|JWT issuance, OTP, RBAC middleware|Redis (token blacklist)|Rarely; stateless|
|Registration Service|Form ingestion, validation, job queuing|Redis (job queue), PostgreSQL|High reg volume|
|AI Processing Service|Celery workers: embed, dedup, skill extract|Gemini API, SentenceTransformer, pgvector|CPU/GPU bound|
|Team Service|Team CRUD, recommendations, auto-formation|pgvector, PostgreSQL|Hackathon start|
|Submission Service|Idea CRUD, versioning, categorization|Gemini API, PostgreSQL|Submission deadline|
|Review Service|Assignment engine, evaluation workflow|scipy, PostgreSQL|Evaluation window|
|Bias Service|Real-time statistical tests, alert generation|scipy.stats, PostgreSQL|Evaluation window|
|Results Service|Score aggregation, NLG feedback, publish|Gemini API, PostgreSQL|Results trigger|
|Communication Service|RAG chatbot, notification scheduler|pgvector, Celery, Gemini API|Event milestones|
|Promotion Service|Content generation, A/B tracking|Gemini API, PostgreSQL|On-demand|
|Analytics Service|Real-time metrics, predictive signals|PostgreSQL, Redis|Dashboard load|
|Audit Service|Hash-chain log writer and verifier|PostgreSQL (insert-only)|Every state change|

### 18.2 Infrastructure Stack

|Layer|Technology|Configuration Notes|
|---|---|---|
|API Gateway|Nginx + Uvicorn|Rate limiting, SSL termination, WebSocket proxy_pass, upstream keepalive 1000|
|Backend Framework|FastAPI (Python 3.11+)|Async handlers, asyncpg connection pool (pool_size=20), Pydantic v2 models|
|Task Queue|Celery 5 + Redis 7|Separate queues: high-priority (registration), low-priority (analytics)|
|Primary Database|PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector 0.5|Max connections: 200; connection pooling via PgBouncer (pool_size=50)|
|Cache / Pub-Sub|Redis 7|Token blacklist, job results cache, WebSocket pub-sub channels|
|Frontend|React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind 3|Vite build, React Query for data fetching, Zustand for state management|
|Real-time|FastAPI WebSockets + Redis pub-sub|All real-time updates flow through Redis channels; WS handlers are subscribers|
|AI Models|SentenceTransformer (local) + Gemini API|Model loaded once per Celery worker; Gemini: exponential backoff, circuit breaker|
|Containerization|Docker 24 + Docker Compose|Separate containers: api, celery-worker-high, celery-worker-low, celery-beat, redis, postgres, nginx|
|Storage|Local volume (dev) / S3-compatible (prod)|Resume PDFs and pitch decks; FaceScan frames are transient and not retained|
|Monitoring|Structlog + Prometheus metrics endpoint|Request latency, queue depth, AI pipeline stage timing, error rates|

## 19. Event Flows

#### 19.1 Registration Event Flow

```text
POST /api/v1/registrations
  → Validate request (Pydantic) → Check OTP verified → Persist raw registration
  → Enqueue job: registration_pipeline.apply_async(registration_id)
  → Return 202 { job_id, ws_channel }

[Celery Worker] registration_pipeline(registration_id):
  STAGE 1: 'PARSING_RESUME'  → publish to WS
    → download resume PDF → Gemini extract text → store parsed_resume
  STAGE 2: 'GENERATING_EMBEDDINGS'  → publish to WS
    → fetch github_summary → encode resume,skills,github → upsert participant_embeddings
    → generate skill_vector via Gemini → upsert skill_vectors
  STAGE 3: 'DUPLICATE_CHECK'  → publish to WS
    → pgvector ANN search top-20 similar embeddings
    → compute weighted similarity for each candidate
    → apply additional signals (device, IP)
    → store duplicate_risk_score, fraud_risk_score
  STAGE 4: 'FINALIZING'  → publish to WS
    → apply threshold → update registration.status
    → create audit_log entry
    → if approved: send confirmation notification
    → if flagged: create admin_task
  COMPLETE: publish final status to WS → client updates UI
```

#### 19.2 Results Event Flow

```text
POST /api/v1/results/{id}/compute  [Admin trigger]
  → Enqueue results_pipeline.apply_async(hackathon_id)

[Celery Worker] results_pipeline(hackathon_id):
  1. Fetch all submitted evaluations
  2. Per-reviewer Z-score normalization
  3. Weighted aggregation by criteria weights
  4. Bootstrap CI (1000 resamples, parallel with numpy)
  5. Sort + tie-break cascade
  6. Batch Gemini feedback generation (up to 10 concurrent)
  7. Persist final_scores, rankings, feedback
  8. Update hackathon.status = 'results_ready'
  9. Return to API; admin reviews before publish
 10. POST /publish → broadcast to WS /ws/results/{id} → all participants notified
```

## 21. Security Architecture

### 21.1 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT RS256: private key signs tokens server-side; public key distributed for verification

- Access token: 15-minute expiry; delivered in HTTP response body

- Refresh token: 7-day expiry; HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Strict cookie (not accessible to JavaScript)

- Token blacklist: Redis SET with TTL matching token expiry; checked on every request

- RBAC middleware: FastAPI dependency injected per-route; roles: admin, participant, reviewer, mentor

- Resource ownership checks: participant can only access their own registration/team/submission

### 21.2 Data Encryption

- PII at rest: AES-256-GCM with per-tenant key; email, name, phone stored encrypted; hash stored for lookups

- Passwords: Argon2id (memory=64MB, parallelism=2, iterations=3) — not bcrypt

- FaceScan: no reusable face embeddings stored. Raw frames are processed transiently, deleted after validation, and represented only by validation status, score, consent timestamp, and salted audit hash.

- TLS 1.3 in transit: Nginx terminates TLS; internal services communicate over Docker network

### 21.3 Input Validation & Injection Prevention

- All API inputs validated via Pydantic v2 models with strict type enforcement

- SQL: asyncpg parameterized queries only; no raw SQL string concatenation

- File uploads: MIME type validation + magic byte check; size limit 10MB; stored outside web root

- Rate limiting: SlowAPI middleware — 100 req/min on auth endpoints, 5 req/min on OTP send

- Content Security Policy header: prevents XSS; no inline scripts in React build

### 21.4 AI Security

- Prompt injection defense: user-controlled text never interpolated directly into system prompts

- Gemini outputs parsed and validated before storage; never executed as code

- GitHub API calls use read-only token; no write permissions; rate limit handling

- AI models loaded from local disk (SentenceTransformer); no external model calls at inference time

## 22. GDPR Architecture

### 22.1 Data Minimization

- Only collect fields with explicit purpose documented; no demographic data unless explicitly needed for bias testing and consented

- FaceScan: strictly optional; purpose statement shown before camera access; no dark patterns; used only for true-person validation and never for duplicate matching

- GitHub: public data only via REST API; no OAuth required

- Phone: collected for OTP verification only; stored as hash after verification

### 22.2 Consent Management

- Registration consent checkbox: 'I agree to [Privacy Policy link]. My data will be used for: registration validation, team matching, hackathon management.' Must be unchecked by default

- Separate opt-in for: FaceScan liveness/personhood validation, with explicit statement that no cross-user face matching is performed

- Separate opt-in for: optional demographic data for bias detection improvement

- Consent timestamp stored in users.gdpr_consent_at; consent version stored

- Consent withdrawal endpoint: POST /api/v1/gdpr/withdraw-consent — stops processing; triggers erasure

### 22.3 Data Subject Rights

|Right|Endpoint|Implementation|
|---|---|---|
|Right to Access (Art. 15)|GET /api/v1/gdpr/my-data|Returns all stored data for user as JSON export|
|Right to Erasure (Art. 17)|DELETE /api/v1/gdpr/my-data|Nulls PII fields; deletes embeddings; anonymizes audit log actor_id|
|Right to Rectification (Art. 16)|PATCH /api/v1/profile/pii|Update name/college with re-validation|
|Right to Portability (Art. 20)|GET /api/v1/gdpr/export|Downloads structured JSON of all user data|
|Right to Object (Art. 21)|POST /api/v1/gdpr/object|Stops automated profiling; flags for manual review|

### 22.4 Data Retention Policy

- Active hackathon data: retained for 90 days after event close

- Evaluation scores (aggregated, anonymized): retained for 2 years for bias research

- FaceScan raw frames: deleted immediately after validation; FaceScan metadata deleted on request or 30 days after event close

- Audit logs: retained for 7 years (legal requirement for transparency claims)

- Automated purge job: Celery beat task runs nightly to delete expired data

## 23. Scalability Strategy

### 23.1 Current Architecture (3-Day Prototype)

- Single Docker Compose deployment: api + celery-worker (2 instances) + celery-beat + redis + postgres + nginx

- PostgreSQL with pgvector: handles 100,000+ embeddings with ivfflat index

- Redis job queue: handles 3-day demo bursts of 200 registrations/minute with backpressure; production path scales to 1000+/minute with more workers

- Target: 100 concurrent users, 200 registrations/minute on a single VM

### 23.2 Path to Production Scale (1000+ Concurrent Users)

1. Database: Add PostgreSQL read replica (asyncpg routes reads to replica); add PgBouncer for connection pooling

1. Celery workers: scale worker containers horizontally (10+ workers for AI tasks)

1. pgvector: Partition participant_embeddings table by hackathon_id; add HNSW index for faster ANN search

1. API: Deploy multiple FastAPI containers behind Nginx load balancer with least_conn algorithm

1. Redis: Sentinel setup for high availability; separate instances for cache vs queue vs pub-sub

1. CDN: Serve React static build from Cloudflare CDN; cache API responses for public hackathon data

1. S3-compatible storage: Move resume and pitch files to MinIO or AWS S3; keep FaceScan frames transient

### 23.3 AI Throughput Optimization

- SentenceTransformer: load model once per worker; batch encode up to 32 registrations per call

- Gemini API: async concurrent requests (max 10 parallel); circuit breaker with 30s timeout; fallback to smaller model

- pgvector ANN search: ivfflat with lists=100 for 100K embeddings; HNSW for production (no re-indexing needed)

- Embedding cache: Redis TTL-based cache for GitHub embeddings (GitHub data changes infrequently)

### 23.4 Queue Architecture

```text
Redis Lists (Celery Queues):
  registration_high:  priority queue for registration pipeline jobs (SLA: 30s)
  ai_low:             batch jobs — team formation, reviewer assignment (SLA: 5min)
  notifications:      email/WS push notifications (SLA: 60s)
  analytics:          metrics aggregation (SLA: 5min, can drop on overload)

Worker pools:
  celery-worker-high:  4 workers, consumes registration_high + ai_low
  celery-worker-notif: 2 workers, consumes notifications
```

## 24. Analytics Dashboard Design

> NOTE: This section addresses a GAP in the proposed solution. The PDF (Section 4.7) requires a real-time analytics dashboard. It is not in the proposed solution and must be built.

### 24.1 Dashboard Sections

#### Live Overview (Top Cards)

- Total Registrations | Approved | Pending Review | Flagged — with real-time WebSocket updates

- Teams Formed | Complete Teams | Incomplete Teams — progress ring chart

- Submissions Received | Evaluations Submitted | Pending — linear progress bar

- Active Bias Alerts — red badge with click-to-drill-down

#### Registration Analytics

- Registration rate over time: line chart (registrations per hour)

- Skill distribution heatmap: 10-skill radar chart for all participants aggregated

- College distribution: horizontal bar chart — top 20 colleges

- Duplicate risk distribution: histogram of duplicate_risk_score values

#### Team Formation Analytics

- Coverage score distribution: all teams — histogram

- Uncovered skills radar: which skills are most scarce across all teams

- Team size distribution: bar chart

- Auto-formed vs self-formed ratio: donut chart

#### Evaluation Analytics

- Reviewer completion rate: table per reviewer with % complete + time remaining

- Score distribution per criterion: box plot per reviewer — visual outlier detection

- Bias alert timeline: horizontal scroll list of alerts with severity and resolution status

- Fairness score gauge: 0-100 composite score updated in real-time

#### Predictive Insights Panel

- Teams at risk of not submitting: based on engagement score (logins, chat activity, submission drafts)

- Estimated final participation rate: simple logistic regression on historical patterns

- Reviewer load forecast: predicted time to completion per reviewer based on current rate

### 24.2 Implementation

- React frontend: Recharts for charts; react-query polling every 30s; WebSocket for live metrics

- Backend: GET /api/v1/analytics/{hackathon_id}/overview returns pre-aggregated metrics

- Metrics aggregated by Celery beat task every 5 minutes; stored in analytics_snapshots table

- Real-time deltas pushed via WebSocket /ws/dashboard/{hackathon_id} channel

- PDF export: backend generates executive summary PDF via pdfkit; POST /api/v1/analytics/{id}/export

## 26. 3-Day Implementation Roadmap

Adjusted for a 3-day development window — prioritize working demos over perfect polish. Build the P0 path end-to-end first: registration + FaceScan validation, duplicate analysis, team/reviewer assignment, bias detection, hash-chain audit, results, and Promotion AI. Analytics, chatbot, appeals, and forecasting are demo-depth unless time remains.

### Day 1: Foundation + Registration AI (Hours 1-15)

#### Hours 1-4: Project Setup

- Initialize: FastAPI app, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, Docker Compose, React + Vite

- Database: apply all migrations (schema from Section 15); seed mock data script

- Auth: JWT RS256 login, registration, RBAC middleware; 4 user roles working

#### Hours 36-40: Analytics Dashboard + Appeal Flow

- Admin analytics dashboard: Recharts charts for registration funnel, skill heatmap, bias alerts, reviewer completion

- Real-time dashboard WebSocket: live registration counter, submission count, alert badge

- Appeal submission form: participant explains dispute, selects affected criteria; admin review queue

#### Hours 41-45: Polish + Demo Prep

- UI/UX polish: responsive design, loading states, error boundaries, empty states

- Mock data generation script: 50 participants (diverse skills/colleges), 10 reviewers, 15 submissions, injected bias patterns

- Docker Compose deployment on cloud VM (render.com free tier or Fly.io)

- Documentation: README with setup, API docs (FastAPI auto-generated at /docs), architecture diagram

- Demo script: 10-minute walkthrough covering all evaluation criteria with live AI demonstrations

### 26.2 Feature Priority Matrix

|Feature|Priority|Judging Impact|If Time Runs Out|
|---|---|---|---|
|Registration + Duplicate Detection|P0 (Must Have)|Technical 40%|Core differentiator; do not cut|
|FaceScan Personhood Validation|P0 (Must Have)|Feature + Security + UX|If camera fails, route to manual review but keep the status flow|
|Skill Vectors + Team Formation|P0 (Must Have)|Technical + Feature|Core differentiator; do not cut|
|Reviewer Assignment + Bias Detection|P0 (Must Have)|Technical + Feature|Core differentiator; do not cut|
|Hash-Chain Audit Trail|P0 (Must Have)|Technical + Feature|Simple to implement; do not cut|
|RAG Chatbot|P1 (Should Have)|Feature + Innovation|Demo with mock if RAG fails|
|Analytics Dashboard|P1 (Should Have)|Feature + UX|Simplify to 3 charts if needed|
|Promotion AI|P1 (Should Have)|Feature + Innovation|Simplify to one generated variant per channel if time-constrained|
|Appeal Workflow|P2 (Nice to Have)|Feature|Remove if time-constrained|
|Personalized Feedback NLG|P1 (Should Have)|UX + Innovation|Show Gemini output in demo|
|GDPR Consent Flow|P1 (Should Have)|Technical compliance|At minimum: unchecked consent boxes, deletion endpoint, data-use copy|

## 27. Risks and Mitigations

|Risk|Likelihood|Severity|Impact|Mitigation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Gemini API rate limits during demo (free tier: 15 req/min)|High|High|Registration pipeline stalls; chatbot unresponsive|Circuit breaker + exponential backoff; cache Gemini outputs in Redis; pre-generate all embeddings on mock data before demo|
|FaceScan scope creep into biometric matching|Medium|Critical|Regulatory risk; judge concern about ethics|Keep FaceScan limited to true-person/liveness validation; no cross-user matching; delete raw frames; implement deletion endpoint|
|SentenceTransformer model load time on first request|High|Medium|First registration takes 30+ seconds|Pre-warm model by encoding a dummy sentence on Celery worker startup; use smaller model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is 22MB)|
|pgvector ANN accuracy at small dataset size|Medium|Low|With only 50 mock users, cosine dedup less meaningful|Lower similarity threshold for demo; show similarity breakdown panel with raw numbers to judges|
|scipy Hungarian algorithm on large n|Low|Medium|Assignment takes >60s for n=200+|Run as async Celery task; return 202 immediately; WebSocket when complete|
|Blockchain-style audit adds complexity (proposed)|High|Medium|Overengineering wastes development time|MITIGATED: use hash-chain in PostgreSQL as described in this PRD — equivalent tamper-evidence at 1/10th the complexity|
|Team runs out of time on Day 2|Medium|High|Key AI features incomplete|Follow priority matrix strictly (P0 before P1); mock any AI output with realistic pre-computed data for demo|
|WebSocket connection stability on free-tier cloud|Medium|Medium|Live demo connection drops during judging|Implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff in React; have fallback HTTP polling every 5s|
|Inconsistent mock data makes AI look ineffective|Medium|High|Duplicate detection shows 0 duplicates; bias detection shows no alerts|Generate intentional duplicates (2 registrations with 85% similarity); generate intentional bias pattern (one reviewer scores 40% below average)|
|Promotion AI gets cut during polish|Medium|Medium|Feature Coverage deduction because PDF explicitly requires it|Keep a minimal generator: one prompt, four channel outputs, editable variants, mock engagement counters|
|Missing Analytics Dashboard|Already occurred|High|Feature Coverage deduction|RESOLVED: Analytics Dashboard & Predictive Insights fully detailed in Section 24|
