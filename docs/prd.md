## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview

**Product Name:** HackOS — AI-Enabled Hackathon Management Platform  
**Problem Statement:** Hackathon organizers waste 20–30 hours per event on fragmented coordination across 5–7 tools. Evaluation processes carry undisclosed bias, participants experience communication gaps, and manual processes collapse beyond 50 participants.

**Solution:** A unified, role-based 3-day MVP that automates the highest-value hackathon workflows using measurable AI components: intelligent registration deduplication, FaceScan personhood validation, skill-vector-based team formation, expertise-matched reviewer assignment, statistically rigorous bias detection, Promotion AI, and a tamper-evident audit trail.

**Core Differentiators:**
- **Resume Auto-Fill**: Participants upload resume, Gemini auto-fills the entire registration form.
- Multi-signal duplicate detection with explainable similarity breakdown (not just email check)
- FaceScan true-person validation using consented liveness checks, not cross-user face matching
- Hungarian-algorithm-optimized reviewer assignment with live cost comparison vs. naive round-robin
- Statistical bias detection (Mann-Whitney U, z-score, inter-reviewer reliability) with confidence intervals — not threshold rules
- SHA-256 hash chain audit log with real-time chain integrity verification
- **Gamified Leaderboards**: Real-time evaluation countdowns and reviewer consistency ranks.
- Skill-vector coverage optimization for team formation

**Tech Stack:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind (frontend), Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector, Auth, RLS) + Python Microservice (FastAPI + Celery + SciPy/NumPy, required for statistical tests since Edge Functions cannot run them), sentence-transformers + Gemini Flash (AI), Mocked data (for FaceScan liveness validation), WebSockets (real-time via Supabase Realtime / Redis PubSub).

## 2. Problem Analysis

### 2.1 Root Cause Analysis of Hackathon Failures

| Pain Point (PDF) | Root Cause | AI Solution Mapped |
|---|---|---|
| Fragmented tools (5–7) | No unified data model | Single platform with event-scoped data graph |
| 20–30 hr organizer overhead | Manual coordination at every stage | Automated workflows with human-in-the-loop only at exception points |
| 35% fairness concerns | Subjective reviewer selection + unchecked score variance | Multi-objective assignment + statistical bias monitoring |
| 50% communication gaps | Batch, uncontextualized notifications | RAG chatbot + event-triggered personalized alerts |
| Collapse beyond 50 participants | O(n²) manual matching processes | Algorithmic assignment with O(n log n) complexity |

### 2.2 What the Problem Statement Actually Rewards

Reading the judging criteria (§8.2) carefully reveals the scoring hierarchy:

- **"AI implementation accuracy and effectiveness"** — judges will ask for numbers. Every AI component must have a measurable metric attached, demonstrated live, not claimed.
- **"Innovation and uniqueness of AI implementations"** — the bias detection approach is the highest-differentiation component because it uses real statistics (Mann-Whitney U, confidence intervals) rather than threshold rules, which almost no competitor will implement.
- **"Workflow coherence"** — the entire hackathon lifecycle must feel like one system, not seven disconnected features.
- **"Comprehensive audit trails"** — explicitly listed. The hash chain must be real and verifiable on demand.

## 4. User Personas

### 4.1 Hackathon Organizer / Admin

**Name:** Priya — VIT Technical Fest Coordinator  
**Goals:** Run a 500-participant hackathon with 3 organizing committee members. Needs to reduce coordination overhead, ensure evaluation is defensible to participants, and produce post-event analytics for institutional reporting.  
**Pain Points:** Currently uses Google Forms + WhatsApp groups + Excel sheets. Spent 18 hours on the last hackathon managing reviewer conflicts manually. Two teams complained about biased evaluation — couldn't prove otherwise.  
**Success Metric:** Can configure and launch a hackathon in under 30 minutes. Can generate a bias-free evaluation report after results.  
**Technical Comfort:** Moderate. Can understand dashboards but won't read algorithm details.

### 4.2 Participant

**Name:** Arjun — Third-year CSE student  
**Goals:** Register, find teammates with complementary skills, submit project, get fair evaluation and meaningful feedback.  
**Pain Points:** "I missed the announcement about the submission deadline because it was buried in a Discord thread."  
**Success Metric:** Registration takes under 5 minutes. Gets notified about deadlines through the platform. Receives specific feedback on why his team didn't win.  
**Technical Comfort:** High. Will test edge cases and try to game the system.

### 4.3 Reviewer / Judge

**Name:** Dr. Anita — Industry professional, AI domain expertise  
**Goals:** Evaluate 8–12 projects in her domain fairly and efficiently. Avoid conflicts of interest without manually tracking them.  
**Pain Points:** In past hackathons, was assigned to review a project by her own former intern without being notified of the conflict. Has no standardized rubric.  
**Success Metric:** Receives only projects in her domain. Conflict check happens automatically. Rubric is clear and consistent.  
**Technical Comfort:** High. Will notice if the bias detection methodology is statistically sound or fabricated.

## 8. Detailed AI System Design Overview

### 8.1 Hybrid Architecture Rationale

The core system uses a hybrid approach:
- **Supabase:** Provides Edge caching, Auth, Row Level Security (RLS), and the primary PostgreSQL database (with pgvector).
- **Python Microservice:** A FastAPI + Celery backend is required because critical components (like SciPy for statistical bias tests and NumPy for assignment algorithms) cannot run within Supabase Edge Functions.
- **Redis:** Manages Celery task queues, atomic locks for deduplication/audit logs, and Pub/Sub for bridging real-time WebSocket events.

### 8.3 AI Component Selection Rationale

| Component | Choice | Why | Alternative Considered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text embeddings | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (local) | 384-dim, 80ms/call, no API cost, runs on CPU | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small: good but costs money + network latency |
| Skill extraction | Gemini Flash | Structured JSON output, understands domain context better than classification | spaCy NER: faster but needs domain fine-tuning |
| Assignment optimizer | scipy `linear_sum_assignment` | Hungarian algorithm, exact O(n³), handles constraint weights | Google OR-Tools: more powerful but heavier setup |
| Bias statistics | scipy.stats (mannwhitneyu, kruskal, zscore) | Non-parametric, correct for small samples, no normality assumption. Utilizes Bonferroni corrections. | t-test: wrong for ordinal score data |
| NLG feedback | Gemini Flash | Contextual, personalized output from score data | Template-based: faster but less impressive in demo |
| Chatbot retrieval | pgvector + sentence-transformers | Same model as registration, single stack | Pinecone: managed but adds external dependency |
| Fuzzy matching | RapidFuzz (Jaro-Winkler) | Fast, handles transliterations well | difflib: slower, less robust |

## 9. Registration Intelligence Architecture

### 9.1 Architecture Overview

The registration pipeline is a multi-stage async processor. The synchronous API handler validates input, persists the raw registration, and enqueues a Celery task. The client subscribes to a WebSocket channel keyed by job_id to receive real-time stage updates. We follow hard invariants first (like username, contact info, email), then fuzzy searches, and finally device fingerprinting.

#### 9.2 Duplicate Detection Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Hard Invariants & Exact Matching (< 10ms)

- Email exact match → immediate flag as duplicate; no further processing

- Contact info (Phone hash) match → immediate flag

- GitHub username exact match → immediate flag

#### Stage 2: Fuzzy Name + Institution Matching (< 50ms)

```text
name_sim = RapidFuzz.token_sort_ratio(name_a.lower(), name_b.lower()) / 100
college_sim = RapidFuzz.token_sort_ratio(normalize_college(c_a), normalize_college(c_b)) / 100
# College normalization: lowercase, expand abbreviations (IIT->indian institute of technology)
```

#### Stage 3: Device Fingerprinting

```text
# Device/IP correlation checks
device_match = check_fingerprint_correlation(device_fp_a, device_fp_b)
ip_match = check_ip_subnet_velocity(ip_address_a, ip_address_b)
```

#### Stage 4: FaceScan Personhood Validation (Optional, < 3s if consented)

```text
# FaceScan is NOT duplicate detection and NOT identity matching.
# Goal: validate that the registrant appears to be a real live person.

person_validation = run_liveness_check(
  checks=['face_present', 'blink_detected', 'head_turn_detected'],
  max_duration_seconds=8
)

if person_validation.score >= 0.75:
    person_validation_status = 'verified'
elif consent_declined or camera_unavailable:
    person_validation_status = 'manual_review'
else:
    person_validation_status = 'review_required'

# Raw frames are deleted immediately after validation.
# Store only status, score, consent timestamp, and audit metadata.
```

#### Stage 5: Weighted Score Computation

```text
W = {'name': 0.60, 'college': 0.40}
score = sum(W[k]*sim[k] for k in W)

# Device/IP bonus signals (additive):
if device_match: score += 0.30
if ip_match:     score += 0.20
score = min(score, 1.0)  # cap at 1.0

# FaceScan is intentionally not included in this score.
```

#### Stage 6: Threshold + Decision

|Score Range|Decision|Action|
|---|---|---|
|0.00 – 0.69|ACCEPT|Auto-approve; trigger embeddings generation; send confirmation|
|0.70 – 0.84|MANUAL REVIEW|Flag with similarity explanation; admin must review within 24h|
|0.85+|POTENTIAL DUPLICATE|Block registration; show which existing registration matched and why|
|Any: exact email/phone/username match|HARD DUPLICATE|Immediate block; no further processing|

#### 9.3 Similarity Explanation

When a registration is flagged, the admin dashboard shows a breakdown card: similarity score per dimension (as a bar chart), matching registration profile (anonymized), device/IP signals, and a recommended action (Approve / Reject / Request Clarification from participant).

#### 9.4 Privacy-Preserving AI Design

- Sensitive fields (email, phone, name) stored in PostgreSQL encrypted at rest (AES-256); never sent directly to Gemini

- Gemini receives: resume text content only (no PII); skills description; GitHub public data

- FaceScan validation stores no cross-user embeddings. Raw frames are deleted after validation; only status, score, consent timestamp, and optional salted capture hash are retained for audit.

- Audit log records every duplicate check decision with actor, timestamp, and score breakdown

- GDPR right-to-erasure: endpoint deletes embeddings, FaceScan metadata, PII fields nulled, registration anonymized

> CRITICAL: FaceScan requires explicit opt-in consent with clear purpose explanation at registration time. Implement a "Delete My FaceScan Data" action in participant settings. If consent is declined, use manual organizer review instead of blocking registration.

## 10. Intelligent Team Formation & Participant Intelligence Architecture

### 10.1 Participant Intelligence Pipeline

The platform transforms unstructured participant data into structured representations that can be reused across team formation, reviewer matching, duplicate detection, recommendation systems, and analytics.

Rather than performing repeated AI inference for every downstream feature, HackOS generates a unified participant profile during registration.

#### Processing Pipeline

```text
Resume Upload
      │
      ▼
Document Parser (PyMuPDF / Unstructured)
      │
      ▼
Structured Information Extraction (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
      │
      ▼
Participant Feature Generation
      ├── Skill Vector
      ├── Expertise Tags
      ├── Seniority Score
      ├── Domain Classification
      └── Unified Embedding
      │
      ▼
Participant Feature Store (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
```

#### Structured Extraction

Gemini is used only once during profile creation to transform resumes into structured metadata.

**Example extracted schema:**

```json
{
  "skills": ["Python", "FastAPI", "Docker", "PyTorch"],
  "domains": ["AI", "Backend Systems"],
  "experience_level": "Intermediate",
  "projects": ["..."],
  "leadership_experience": true,
  "hackathon_experience": 4
}
```

This structured representation becomes the source of truth for all downstream intelligence services.

---

### 10.2 Multi-Dimensional Skill Vector Generation

Each participant is represented as a normalized 10-dimensional skill vector.

```json
[
    "backend",
    "frontend",
    "ai_ml",
    "design",
    "cloud",
    "security",
    "mobile",
    "data_engineering",
    "devops",
    "product"
]
```

#### Scoring Methodology

Skill scores are generated from:

- Resume content
- Project history
- Technology usage frequency
- GitHub metadata
- Certifications
- Self-declared skills

Scores are normalized to `0.0 <= skill_score <= 1.0`.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "backend": 0.92,
  "frontend": 0.34,
  "ai_ml": 0.88,
  "cloud": 0.61,
  "design": 0.12
}
```

**Storage:**

```sql
participant_skill_vectors(
    user_id,
    hackathon_id,
    vector float[10]
)
```

The skill vector serves as the primary representation for team balancing and coverage optimization.

---

### 10.3 Unified Participant Embeddings

To eliminate redundant computation across multiple AI modules, HackOS generates a single semantic embedding per participant.

**Embedding Input:**

```text
Resume Summary + Skills + Projects + GitHub Profile Summary + Interests + Preferred Problem Statements
```

**Example:**

```python
embedding_input = f"""
{resume_summary}
{skills}
{projects}
{github_summary}
{interests}
{preferred_problem_statement}
"""
```

**Embedding Model:**

`BGE-Large` / `Gemini Embeddings`

**Output:**

`vector(768)`

**Storage:**

```sql
participant_embeddings(
    user_id,
    hackathon_id,
    embedding vector(768)
)
```

The same embedding powers:

- Team Formation
- Reviewer Matching
- Duplicate Detection
- Team Recommendations
- Participant Search
- Analytics

This reduces storage overhead and avoids repeated inference costs.

---

### 10.4 Problem Statement Coverage Model

Each problem statement defines the minimum skill coverage required for a successful team.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "ai_ml": 0.70,
    "backend": 0.60,
    "frontend": 0.50,
    "cloud": 0.40,
    "design": 0.40
}
```

#### Team Skill Representation

For a team:

```text
team_vector(skill) = max(member.skill[skill])
```

The strongest contributor satisfies the corresponding skill requirement.

#### Coverage Score

```text
coverage_score = Σ(min(team_skill, required_skill)) / Σ(required_skill)
```

**Output:** `0.0 → 1.0`

**Interpretation:**

| Coverage Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| < 0.60 | Poorly Balanced |
| 0.60–0.80 | Functional |
| 0.80–0.90 | Strong |
| > 0.90 | Highly Balanced |

Teams reaching 0.85+ coverage are considered formation-ready.

---

### 10.5 Scalable Team Formation Engine

#### Challenge

A naive matching approach becomes computationally infeasible beyond a few thousand participants.
For 100,000 participants: `100,000² = 10 Billion Comparisons`.

HackOS therefore uses a distributed bucketed formation strategy.

#### Stage 1: Participant Partitioning

Participants are grouped into formation pools based on:

- Preferred Problem Statement
- Experience Level
- Time Zone
- Availability Window

**Example:**

```text
AI Healthcare
 ├─ Beginner
 ├─ Intermediate
 └─ Advanced
```

This reduces search space dramatically and enables parallel processing.

#### Stage 2: Coverage-Driven Team Assembly

For each incomplete team:

```text
coverage_gap = required_coverage - current_team_vector
```

Each candidate receives:

```text
gap_fill_score = dot(participant_skill_vector, coverage_gap)
```

Highest-scoring participants are selected first.

**Benefits:**

- Explainable
- Deterministic
- Fast
- Scales linearly

**Complexity:** `O(n)` per assignment cycle.

#### Stage 3: Diversity Optimization

After skill coverage is satisfied, diversity objectives are optimized.
Dimensions include:

- Skill Diversity
- College Diversity
- Geographic Diversity
- Experience Diversity

**Diversity score:**

```text
diversity_score = entropy(team_distribution)
```

Higher entropy indicates better-balanced teams.

#### Stage 4: Local Optimization Pass

Following initial formation: `Team A ↔ Team B` member swaps are evaluated.

Swap accepted if: `coverage ↑ AND diversity ↑`

This improves overall formation quality without expensive global optimization algorithms.

---

### 10.6 Team Formation Engine

HackOS uses a multi-stage coverage-driven team formation engine designed to balance technical competency, diversity, and scalability.
The system is optimized for large-scale hackathons and can operate efficiently across thousands of participants while maintaining explainable team assignment decisions.

#### Formation Workflow

**Stage 1: Participant Pool Generation**

Approved participants are grouped into formation pools based on:

- Preferred Problem Statement
- Experience Level
- Availability Window
- Team Size Preferences

This reduces the search space and enables parallel processing of independent participant groups.

**Stage 2: Coverage Gap Analysis**

Each problem statement defines a required skill coverage profile.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "ai_ml": 0.70,
    "backend": 0.60,
    "frontend": 0.50,
    "cloud": 0.40,
    "design": 0.40
}
```

For every incomplete team, the system computes the current team coverage and identifies missing competencies.

```text
coverage_gap = required_coverage - current_team_vector
```

This gap represents the skills that should be prioritized in subsequent member assignments.

**Stage 3: Candidate Scoring**

Every unassigned participant within the formation pool is scored against the team’s current skill gap.

```text
gap_fill_score = dot(participant_skill_vector, coverage_gap)
```

A higher score indicates that the participant contributes more strongly toward satisfying the team’s missing requirements.
The highest-scoring participant is assigned to the team. Coverage is recalculated after each assignment.

This process repeats until:

- Team coverage exceeds the target threshold
- Maximum team size is reached
- No suitable candidates remain

**Stage 4: Diversity Optimization**

Once technical coverage requirements are satisfied, the system evaluates team diversity.
Dimensions include:

- Skill Diversity
- Experience Diversity
- Institution Diversity
- Geographic Diversity

Diversity is measured using entropy-based scoring.

```text
diversity_score = entropy(team_distribution)
```

Where multiple candidate assignments achieve similar coverage scores, the assignment producing higher diversity is preferred.

**Stage 5: Local Optimization Pass**

After initial team formation, a refinement stage evaluates potential member swaps between teams.
A swap is accepted only if it improves one or more of:

- Coverage Score
- Diversity Score
- Team Balance

while not degrading the remaining metrics.
This optimization improves overall formation quality without requiring computationally expensive global optimization algorithms.

---

#### Team Validation Framework

Every generated team is evaluated against objective quality metrics before finalization.

**Coverage Validation**

Measures how effectively required technical competencies are satisfied.

```text
coverage_score ∈ [0,1]
Target: coverage_score ≥ 0.85
```

**Diversity Validation**

Measures distribution across skills, experience levels, and participant backgrounds.
Higher entropy indicates stronger diversity.

**Balance Validation**

Ensures that no team is disproportionately stronger or weaker than others.

```text
Metric: team_strength_variance
Target: variance < predefined threshold
```

**Formation Confidence Score**

Final team quality score:

```text
formation_confidence = 0.5 * coverage_score + 0.3 * diversity_score + 0.2 * balance_score
Output: 0.0 – 1.0
```

**Interpretation:**

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| < 0.60 | Poor Team |
| 0.60 – 0.80 | Acceptable Team |
| 0.80 – 0.90 | Strong Team |
| > 0.90 | Highly Optimized Team |

Only teams exceeding the minimum confidence threshold are finalized automatically.

---

#### Scalability Characteristics

The formation engine is designed for horizontal scaling.
Key optimizations include:

- Pool-based participant partitioning
- Vectorized skill scoring
- Parallel formation workers
- Event-driven processing
- Incremental coverage updates

**Expected performance:**

| Participants | Formation Time |
|---|---|
| 1,000 | < 10 sec |
| 10,000 | < 1 min |
| 100,000 | < 5 min |

This enables HackOS to support university, enterprise, and global-scale hackathons without changes to the underlying formation logic.

---

### 10.7 Scalability Architecture

The team formation subsystem is designed as an event-driven distributed service.

```text

      ▼
Kafka Event Bus
      │
      ▼

      │
      ▼
Formation Workers
      │
      ▼

```

#### Infrastructure Components

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Feature Store | PostgreSQL |
| Vector Search | pgvector |
| Cache | Redis |
| Event Streaming | Kafka |
| AI Processing | Gemini + Embedding Models |
| Distributed Compute | Ray |
| Realtime Updates | WebSockets |

#### Target Scale

| Metric | Capacity |
|---|---|
| Participants | 100,000+ |
| Concurrent Registrations | 5,000/min |
| Team Formation Runtime | <5 min |
| Duplicate Detection Queries | <100 ms |
| Reviewer Matching Runtime | <60 sec |
| Embedding Similarity Search | <50 ms |

The architecture scales horizontally by increasing worker nodes without modifying application logic, enabling HackOS to support large university, enterprise, and global hackathons.


## 11. Reviewer Intelligence Architecture

### 11.1 Reviewer Intelligence Pipeline

HackOS transforms reviewer resumes, professional profiles, research interests, judging history, and declared expertise into structured reviewer representations used throughout the evaluation lifecycle.

#### Processing Pipeline

```text
Reviewer Registration
        │
        ▼
Profile Extraction Service
        │
        ▼
Reviewer Intelligence Engine
        │
        ├── Expertise Extraction
        ├── Domain Classification
        ├── Capacity Estimation
        ├── Availability Analysis
        ├── Reliability Scoring
        └── Conflict Detection
        │
        ▼
Reviewer Feature Store
```

Each reviewer is represented as:

```json
{
    "expertise_vector": ["..."],
    "semantic_embedding": ["..."],
    "capacity": 24,
    "availability": "6 hours",
    "reliability_score": 0.95,
    "conflict_metadata": {}
}
```

This representation enables intelligent assignment, workload balancing, conflict prevention, and dynamic reassignment.

---

### 11.2 Expertise Matching Engine

Both project submissions and reviewer profiles are converted into semantic embeddings.

#### Project Representation

Generated from:

- Problem Statement
- Project Description
- Tech Stack
- Architecture Summary
- Submitted Documentation

#### Reviewer Representation

Generated from:

- Resume
- Expertise Areas
- Research Interests
- Professional Experience
- Previous Judging History

The system computes semantic similarity between projects and reviewers.

```text
expertise_score = cosine_similarity(project_embedding, reviewer_embedding)
```

To improve scalability, HackOS does not compare every project against every reviewer.
Instead, Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the top candidate reviewers for each project.

```text
Project
   │
   ▼
Top 50 Candidate Reviewers
```

This reduces computational complexity while preserving assignment quality.

---

### 11.3 Reviewer Capacity & Workload Modeling

Every reviewer is assigned a dynamic review capacity.
Capacity is estimated using:

- Declared Availability
- Historical Review Speed
- Event Duration
- Review Complexity

**Example:**

```text
capacity = available_hours / estimated_review_time
```

A reviewer with:

- **6 Available Hours**
- **15 Minutes Per Review**

can support approximately: **24 Reviews**

The assignment engine never exceeds reviewer capacity limits.
This prevents reviewer fatigue and improves evaluation quality.

---

### 11.4 Conflict Detection Framework

Conflict detection acts as a hard constraint rather than a scoring penalty.
Any reviewer-project pair violating conflict policies is automatically removed from consideration.

#### Supported Conflict Rules

**Institutional Conflict**

Reviewers cannot evaluate projects from:
- Their college
- Their organization
- Their startup
- Their research lab

**Declared Conflicts**

Reviewers may explicitly declare:
- Teams
- Individuals
- Organizations
- Sponsors

...they cannot evaluate.

**Historical Collaboration Detection**

Optional advanced checks include:
- Shared GitHub repositories
- Previous project collaboration
- Mentor-team relationships

If a conflict exists:

```python
assignment_allowed = False
```

The pair is excluded from optimization.
This guarantees zero conflict-of-interest assignments.

---

### 11.5 Assignment Optimization Engine

HackOS models reviewer assignment as a constrained optimization problem.
Each project requires multiple independent reviewers.

**Example:**

```text
Project A
   ├── Reviewer 1
   ├── Reviewer 2
   └── Reviewer 3
```

#### Assignment Score

For every valid reviewer-project pair:

```text
assignment_score = (
    0.45 * expertise_score
  + 0.25 * workload_balance_score
  + 0.15 * availability_score
  + 0.10 * diversity_score
  + 0.05 * reliability_score
)
```

Where:

- **Expertise Score:** Measures reviewer-domain alignment.
- **Workload Balance Score:** Rewards equitable assignment distribution.
- **Availability Score:** Prioritizes reviewers with available judging windows.
- **Diversity Score:** Encourages evaluation from reviewers with complementary backgrounds.
- **Reliability Score:** Rewards reviewers with strong historical completion rates.

#### Optimization Strategy

The assignment engine uses a Min-Cost Flow optimization model implemented with Google OR-Tools.
This enables:

- Multiple reviewers per project
- Reviewer capacity constraints
- Workload balancing
- Hard conflict constraints
- Dynamic reassignment support

Unlike Hungarian-based approaches, Min-Cost Flow scales efficiently to large events while maintaining globally optimized assignments.

---

### 11.6 Assignment Validation Framework

Before assignments are finalized, the system validates overall assignment quality.

**Expertise Coverage Validation**

Each project must satisfy: At least 2 domain-relevant reviewers.
- **Target:** Average Expertise Match > 0.85

**Workload Distribution Validation**

Measures fairness of assignment allocation.
- **Metric:** `workload_variance`
- **Target:** ±10% reviewer workload deviation

**Conflict Validation**

- **Target:** 0 conflict assignments

**Assignment Confidence Score**

Final assignment quality metric:

```text
assignment_confidence = (
    0.50 * expertise_quality
  + 0.30 * workload_balance
  + 0.20 * reliability_coverage
)
```

**Output:** `0.0 – 1.0`

Assignments below the minimum confidence threshold are automatically re-optimized.

---

### 11.7 Dynamic Reassignment & Failure Recovery

HackOS continuously monitors assignment health throughout the evaluation process.

#### Reviewer No-Show Detection

The platform tracks:

- Login Activity
- Assignment Acceptance
- Review Submission Progress
- Deadline Compliance

Reviewers failing to meet activity thresholds are flagged automatically.

#### Automatic Reassignment

If a reviewer becomes unavailable:

```text
Reviewer
      ↓
Projects Returned To Pool
      ↓
Optimization Engine
      ↓
Replacement Assignment
```

Only incomplete reviews are reassigned. Completed reviews remain preserved.

#### Capacity Rebalancing

When:

- Additional reviewers join
- Projects increase
- Reviewers withdraw

...the system automatically redistributes workload while preserving assignment quality.

#### Real-Time Assignment Updates

All assignment changes generate events through:

```text
Redis Pub/Sub
        │
        ▼
WebSocket Gateway
        │
        ▼
Admin Dashboard
```

Organizers receive immediate visibility into:

- Reviewer utilization
- Assignment health
- Reassignment events
- Capacity bottlenecks
- Evaluation progress

---

### 11.8 Scalability Characteristics

The reviewer intelligence subsystem is designed for large-scale hackathons.

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Projects | 20,000+ |
| Reviewers | 5,000+ |
| Review Assignments | 60,000+ |
| Expertise Search Latency | <50 ms |
| Assignment Runtime | <60 sec |
| Reassignment Runtime | <10 sec |
| Conflict Detection Accuracy | >99% |

The architecture scales horizontally by increasing assignment workers and ANN search nodes, enabling enterprise, university, and global-scale hackathons without changes to assignment logic.


## 12. Bias Detection, Fairness & Auditability Architecture

### 12.1 Fairness Intelligence Pipeline

HackOS continuously monitors the evaluation process for statistical bias, reviewer anomalies, scoring inconsistencies, and ranking instability.
Rather than performing periodic manual audits, fairness analysis operates as an asynchronous intelligence service throughout the judging lifecycle.

#### Processing Pipeline

```text
Review Submission
        │
        ▼
Kafka Event Stream
        │
        ▼
Fairness Analytics Workers
        │
        ├── Reviewer Outlier Detection
        ├── Demographic Bias Analysis
        ├── Temporal Drift Detection
        ├── Reliability Measurement
        ├── Ranking Confidence Analysis
        └── Fairness Intervention Engine
        │
        ▼
Bias Dashboard & Audit System
```

Bias analysis executes asynchronously to prevent evaluation latency and scales independently from the core scoring infrastructure.

---

### 12.2 Statistical Rigor & Family-wise Error Control

Running multiple statistical tests simultaneously increases the probability of false-positive alerts.
To control Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER), HackOS applies Bonferroni correction across all active bias tests.

```python
alpha = 0.05
num_tests = 6
adjusted_alpha = alpha / num_tests
# 0.0083
```

A bias alert is only generated when:

```text
p_value < adjusted_alpha
```

This prevents alert fatigue and ensures only statistically significant findings reach administrators.

To avoid low-power statistical conclusions:

**Minimum Sample Size Requirement:**
- `n ≥ 20` observations per comparison group

Tests failing minimum sample size requirements are labeled **Insufficient Statistical Power** rather than generating potentially misleading alerts.

---

### 12.3 Bias Detection Framework

#### Reviewer Outlier Detection

Identifies reviewers whose scoring behavior significantly differs from the overall judging population.

| Metric | Method | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Reviewer Outlier | Z-Score Analysis | `\|z\| > 2.0` (Warning), `\|z\| > 3.0` (Critical) |

#### Gender Bias Detection

Measures whether score distributions differ significantly across gender groups.

| Metric | Statistical Test | Effect Size |
|---|---|---|
| Gender Bias | Mann-Whitney U Test | Rank-Biserial Correlation |

**Alert condition:** `p_adjusted < 0.0083`

#### Geographic Bias Detection

Measures scoring differences across geographic regions.

| Metric | Statistical Test | Effect Size |
|---|---|---|
| Geographic Bias | Kruskal-Wallis H Test | Eta-Squared |

#### Institutional Bias Detection

Measures score variation across institutions, universities, or organizations.

| Metric | Statistical Test | Effect Size |
|---|---|---|
| Institutional Bias | Mann-Whitney U / Kruskal-Wallis | Rank-Biserial / Eta-Squared |

#### Temporal Drift Detection

Detects reviewer fatigue and score drift over time.

**Example:**
- Early Reviews → Average 88
- Late Reviews → Average 72

**Metric:** `spearman(score, review_sequence)`
**Alert threshold:** `abs(rho) > 0.40`

#### Criterion Inconsistency Detection

Measures scoring stability within a reviewer.

**Metric:** Coefficient of Variation (CV)
**Alert threshold:** `CV > 0.50`

This identifies reviewers whose scoring patterns appear unstable or inconsistent.

---

### 12.4 Inter-Rater Reliability & Ranking Confidence

To assess judging consistency, HackOS calculates Krippendorff’s Alpha across overlapping reviewer assignments.

| Alpha | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| > 0.80 | Strong Agreement |
| 0.67 – 0.80 | Acceptable Agreement |
| < 0.67 | Weak Agreement |
| < 0.00 | Systematic Disagreement |

This metric quantifies how consistently reviewers evaluate projects.

#### Ranking Confidence Score

Winner selection includes a confidence metric derived from:

```text
ranking_confidence = 0.60 * inter_rater_agreement + 0.40 * review_coverage
```

**Output:**
- High Confidence
- Medium Confidence
- Low Confidence

**Example:**
- **1st Place Project**
- Final Score: 92.4
- Ranking Confidence: 94%

This provides transparency into ranking reliability.

---

### 12.5 Score Normalization Pipeline

Raw reviewer scores often contain harshness and leniency effects.
To improve fairness, HackOS performs reviewer-level normalization before final ranking generation.

**Standard Normalization:**
```text
normalized_score = (raw_score - reviewer_mean) / reviewer_std
```

**Global Rescaling:**
```text
final_score = normalized_score * global_std + global_mean
```

#### Robust Normalization Safeguard

If `reviewer_std < epsilon`, the system switches to robust normalization using:
- Median
- Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)

This prevents instability caused by reviewers who assign nearly identical scores.

---

### 12.6 Bias Mitigation & Intervention Engine

Detection alone does not improve fairness.
When statistically significant bias is identified, HackOS performs impact analysis to determine whether rankings or project outcomes are materially affected.

Possible interventions include:

- **Score Normalization:** Applied when reviewer harshness or leniency significantly skews outcomes.
- **Secondary Reviewer Assignment:** Projects affected by potential bias may receive additional evaluations.
- **Manual Audit Escalation:** High-severity bias alerts are routed to administrators for review.
- **Reviewer Quality Monitoring:** Repeated bias incidents contribute to reviewer reliability scores and future assignment eligibility.

#### Severity Classification

| Severity | Action |
|---|---|
| Low | Monitor |
| Medium | Administrator Notification |
| High | Additional Review Required |
| Critical | Manual Investigation & Ranking Recalculation |

All interventions are fully auditable.

---

### 12.7 Fairness Validation Framework

Before final results are published, HackOS validates fairness metrics across the entire event.

#### Validation Checks

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Conflict Violations | 0 |
| Significant Bias Events | Investigated |
| Reviewer Agreement | Alpha > 0.67 |
| Review Coverage | 100% |
| Ranking Confidence | > 85% |

Only validated result sets proceed to winner generation.

---

### 12.8 Audit Trail Integrity & Compliance

Every critical evaluation event is stored in an immutable audit chain.
Tracked events include:

- Review Submission
- Score Modification
- Bias Alert Generation
- Reviewer Reassignment
- Administrative Overrides
- Winner Selection
- Ranking Publication

#### Hash-Chained Audit Records

Each audit record stores:

```text
current_hash = SHA256(previous_hash + event_payload + timestamp)
```

This creates a tamper-evident chain across all evaluation events.

#### Concurrent Insert Protection

To maintain chain integrity during peak submission periods:

```sql
pg_advisory_xact_lock()
```

is used to serialize audit-chain writes.

#### GDPR Compliance

User erasure requests anonymize personally identifiable information while preserving audit-chain integrity and statistical records.

---

### 12.9 Scalability Characteristics

The fairness subsystem is designed for large-scale hackathons and enterprise deployments.

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Reviewers | 5,000+ |
| Projects | 20,000+ |
| Review Assignments | 60,000+ |
| Bias Detection Latency | <30 sec |
| Fairness Report Generation | <2 min |
| Ranking Confidence Computation | <1 min |
| Audit Event Throughput | 10,000+ events/min |

The architecture scales horizontally through distributed analytics workers, allowing fairness analysis, bias detection, and audit generation to operate independently of the core evaluation workflow.


I’ve rewritten both sections to match the level of the Team Formation, Reviewer Intelligence, and Bias Detection sections. The focus is on scalability, reliability, explainability, and production architecture rather than implementation details.

## 13. Communication Intelligence Architecture

### 13.1 Communication Intelligence Pipeline

HackOS provides a unified communication layer that combines real-time conversational support, proactive participant engagement, deadline awareness, multilingual communication, and organizer escalation workflows.
The communication subsystem operates continuously throughout the hackathon lifecycle and serves as the primary participant interaction channel.

3. Inject user-specific context
4. Generate grounded response
5. Stream response to the frontend

**User context may include:**
- Registration Status
- Team Membership
- Submission Status
- Reviewer Assignment Status
- Event Participation History

This enables highly personalized responses without exposing private information.

---

### 13.3 Personalization Engine

HackOS personalizes all participant communication using behavioral and contextual signals.

#### Personalization Inputs

- Registration Progress
- Team Status
- Submission Status
- Previous Engagement
- Chatbot Usage History
- Notification Interaction History
- Preferred Language
- Time Zone

#### Example Personalization

**Participant A:**
> You have not completed your submission.
> 2 hours remain before the deadline.

**Participant B:**
> Your project has been successfully submitted.
> Evaluation begins tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

This increases relevance and reduces notification fatigue.

---

### 13.4 Proactive Notification Intelligence

The notification subsystem continuously monitors participant progress and upcoming milestones.

#### Event Categories

- Registration Deadlines
- Team Formation Deadlines

        │
        ▼
Delivery Services
```

Notifications may be delivered through:
- Email
- In-App Alerts
- Push Notifications
- WebSocket Events

#### Adaptive Reminder Strategy

Reminder timing dynamically adjusts based on participant behavior.

| User Type | Reminder Frequency |
|---|---|
| Highly Engaged | Minimal |
| Inactive | Increased |
| At-Risk Submission | Aggressive |
| Completed Tasks | Suppressed |

This prevents over-communication while maximizing completion rates.

---

### 13.5 Multilingual Communication Layer

HackOS automatically supports multilingual communication.
Language preferences are inferred from:

- Registration Data
- User Settings
- Conversation History

Messages are translated before delivery. Supported communication types:

- Chatbot Responses
- Notifications
- Announcements
- Evaluation Feedback
- Organizer Messages

This improves accessibility for geographically distributed hackathons.

---

### 13.6 Confidence & Escalation Framework

The assistant continuously evaluates response confidence.

#### Confidence Evaluation

Factors include:
- Retrieval Similarity
- Context Coverage
- Historical Success Rate
- Knowledge Freshness

**Output:**
- High Confidence
- Medium Confidence
- Low Confidence

#### Organizer Escalation Workflow

Low-confidence queries automatically trigger escalation.

```text
Participant Question
        │
        ▼
Low Confidence Detection
        │
        ▼
Organizer Queue
        │
        ▼
Human Response
        │
        ▼

```

This enables continuous knowledge base improvement while preventing hallucinated responses.

---

### 13.7 Communication Analytics

The platform continuously measures communication effectiveness.

#### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Response Latency | Chatbot response time |
| Resolution Rate | Questions answered successfully |
| Escalation Rate | Human intervention frequency |
| Notification Open Rate | User engagement |
| Completion Conversion Rate | Actions completed after reminders |
| Participant Satisfaction | Communication quality score |

These metrics help organizers optimize future events.

---

### 13.8 Scalability Characteristics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Concurrent Conversations | 10,000+ |
| Notification Throughput | 100,000+/hour |
| Knowledge Documents | 1M+ Chunks |
| Query Response Time | <2 sec |
| Escalation Detection | Real-Time |
| Delivery Success Rate | >99% |

The communication subsystem scales horizontally through independent retrieval, notification, and generation workers.

---

## 14. Results Intelligence & Ranking Architecture

### 14.1 Results Processing Pipeline

The Results Engine transforms raw evaluations into statistically robust rankings, confidence-aware winner selection, personalized feedback, and transparent audit records.

#### Architecture Overview

```text
Review Submissions
        │
        ▼
Validation Engine
        │
        ▼
Normalization Engine
        │
        ▼
Ranking Engine
        │
        ▼
Confidence Analysis
        │
        ▼
Feedback Generation
        │
        ▼
Results Publication
```

All stages are asynchronous and independently scalable.

---

### 14.2 Evaluation Validation Layer

Before ranking begins, HackOS validates evaluation integrity.

**Validation Checks:**
- Missing Reviews
- Duplicate Reviews
- Conflict Violations
- Bias Investigation Status
- Review Coverage Requirements

Only validated datasets proceed to ranking.

---

### 14.3 Score Normalization Engine

Reviewer scoring behavior varies significantly.
To reduce harshness and leniency effects, HackOS applies reviewer-level normalization.

#### Normalization Workflow

```text
Raw Scores
      │
      ▼
Reviewer Normalization
      │
      ▼
Global Rescaling
      │
      ▼
Normalized Scores
```

**Benefits:**
- Fairer Rankings
- Reduced Reviewer Bias
- Improved Cross-Reviewer Comparability

---

### 14.4 Ranking Computation Engine

Final rankings are computed using weighted aggregation. Each hackathon defines custom evaluation criteria.

**Example:**
- Innovation: 40%
- Technical Complexity: 30%
- Impact: 20%
- Presentation: 10%

**Final score:**
```text
final_score = Σ(weight × normalized_criterion_score)
```

This enables flexible evaluation frameworks across different hackathons.

---

### 14.5 Statistical Confidence Analysis

HackOS evaluates ranking stability using bootstrap resampling.

#### Bootstrap Framework

For each team:
- 1000 Resamples
- 95% Confidence Interval

**Output:**
- Mean Score
- Confidence Interval
- Ranking Stability

**Example:**
- **Team A**
- Score: 91.4
- 95% CI: 89.8 – 92.7

This quantifies uncertainty rather than treating rankings as absolute.

---

### 14.6 Tie Resolution Framework

When confidence intervals overlap significantly, rankings may not be statistically distinguishable.

#### Tie Resolution Cascade

| Level | Resolution Rule |
|---|---|
| 1 | Highest Primary Criterion Score |
| 2 | Highest Secondary Criterion Score |
| 3 | Earliest Valid Submission |
| 4 | Administrator Review |

All tie-break decisions are recorded in the audit system.

---

### 14.7 Ranking Confidence Engine

Each ranking receives a confidence score.

**Inputs:**
- Review Coverage
- Inter-Rater Agreement
- Bootstrap Stability
- Bias Investigation Status

**Output:**
- High Confidence
- Medium Confidence
- Low Confidence

**Example:**
- **Rank #1**
- Final Score: 92.4
- Confidence: 96%

This provides transparency into winner selection.

---

### 14.8 Personalized Feedback Generation

HackOS automatically generates detailed feedback for every team.

**Inputs:**
- Criterion Scores
- Reviewer Comments
- Comparative Performance
- Project Metadata

**Generated feedback includes:**
- **Performance Summary:** Overall evaluation outcome.
- **Key Strengths:** Evidence-based positive observations.
- **Improvement Opportunities:** Actionable recommendations.
- **Future Development Path:** Suggested next steps for project growth.

Feedback generation runs asynchronously to prevent result publication delays.

---

audit_log: standalone hash-chain, references entity_id + entity_type (logical, not FK)
knowledge_base: hackathon_id FK + pgvector embedding column (ivfflat index)
chat_messages: session_id FK + optional pgvector context_embedding
```

#### Key Indexing Strategy

- registrations: INDEX ON (hackathon_id, status) — admin review queue

- participant_embeddings: ivfflat INDEX ON embedding vector_cosine_ops — ANN search

- knowledge_base: ivfflat INDEX ON embedding vector_cosine_ops — RAG retrieval

- audit_log: INDEX ON (entity_type, entity_id) — per-entity history lookup

- evaluations: INDEX ON (submission_id, status) — results aggregation

- bias_alerts: INDEX ON (hackathon_id, is_active) — dashboard alert count

## 18. Service Architecture

### 18.1 Service Decomposition

The system is designed as a modular monolith (for 3-day development feasibility) with clear service boundaries that allow extraction into true microservices for production scaling. Each module is a FastAPI router with its own business logic layer.

|Service Module|Responsibilities|External Dependencies|Scaling Trigger|
|---|---|---|---|
|Auth Service|JWT issuance, OTP, RBAC middleware|Redis (token blacklist)|Rarely; stateless|
|Registration Service|Form ingestion, validation, job queuing|Redis (job queue), PostgreSQL|High reg volume|
|AI Processing Service|Celery workers: embed, dedup, skill extract|Gemini API, SentenceTransformer, pgvector|CPU/GPU bound|
|Team Service|Team CRUD, recommendations, auto-formation|pgvector, PostgreSQL|Hackathon start|
|Submission Service|Idea CRUD, versioning, categorization|Gemini API, PostgreSQL|Submission deadline|
|Review Service|Assignment engine, evaluation workflow|scipy, PostgreSQL|Evaluation window|
|Bias Service|Real-time statistical tests, alert generation|scipy.stats, PostgreSQL|Evaluation window|
|Results Service|Score aggregation, NLG feedback, publish|Gemini API, PostgreSQL|Results trigger|
|Communication Service|RAG chatbot, notification scheduler|pgvector, Celery, Gemini API|Event milestones|
|Promotion Service|Content generation, A/B tracking|Gemini API, PostgreSQL|On-demand|
|Analytics Service|Real-time metrics, predictive signals|PostgreSQL, Redis|Dashboard load|
|Audit Service|Hash-chain log writer and verifier|PostgreSQL (insert-only)|Every state change|

### 18.2 Infrastructure Stack

|---|---|---|
|Backend Services|Supabase|Handles PostgreSQL DB, pgvector, Authentication, and Edge Functions|
|Primary Database|Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector|Stores user data, embeddings, and hackathon state natively|
|AI / Worker Microservice|Python (FastAPI) or Supabase Edge Functions|Handles Gemini API calls, SentenceTransformers, and Assignment algorithms|
|Frontend|React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind 3|Vite build, Supabase Client, Zustand for state management|
|Real-time|Supabase Realtime|Native Postgres change data capture and broadcast to clients|
|AI Models|SentenceTransformer (local) + Gemini API|Used for deduplication, skill vector mapping, and feedback generation|
|Storage|Supabase Storage|Used for uploading Resume PDFs and pitch decks|
|FaceScan|Mocked UI Component|Mocked webcam interface returning predefined validation states|

## 19. Event Flows

#### 19.1 Registration Event Flow

```text
POST /api/v1/registrations
  → Validate request (Pydantic) → Check OTP verified → Persist raw registration
  → Enqueue job: registration_pipeline.apply_async(registration_id)
  → Return 202 { job_id, ws_channel }

[Celery Worker] registration_pipeline(registration_id):
  STAGE 1: 'PARSING_RESUME'  → publish to WS
    → download resume PDF → Gemini extract text → store parsed_resume
  STAGE 2: 'GENERATING_EMBEDDINGS'  → publish to WS
    → fetch github_summary → encode resume,skills,github → upsert participant_embeddings
    → generate skill_vector via Gemini → upsert skill_vectors
  STAGE 3: 'DUPLICATE_CHECK'  → publish to WS
    → pgvector ANN search top-20 similar embeddings
    → compute weighted similarity for each candidate
    → apply additional signals (device, IP)
    → store duplicate_risk_score, fraud_risk_score
  STAGE 4: 'FINALIZING'  → publish to WS
    → apply threshold → update registration.status
    → create audit_log entry
    → if approved: send confirmation notification
    → if flagged: create admin_task
  COMPLETE: publish final status to WS → client updates UI
```

#### 19.2 Results Event Flow

```text
POST /api/v1/results/{id}/compute  [Admin trigger]
  → Enqueue results_pipeline.apply_async(hackathon_id)

[Celery Worker] results_pipeline(hackathon_id):
  1. Fetch all submitted evaluations
  2. Per-reviewer Z-score normalization
  3. Weighted aggregation by criteria weights
  4. Bootstrap CI (1000 resamples, parallel with numpy)
  5. Sort + tie-break cascade
  6. Batch Gemini feedback generation (up to 10 concurrent)
  7. Persist final_scores, rankings, feedback
  8. Update hackathon.status = 'results_ready'
  9. Return to API; admin reviews before publish
 10. POST /publish → broadcast to WS /ws/results/{id} → all participants notified
```

## 21. Security Architecture

### 21.1 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT RS256: private key signs tokens server-side; public key distributed for verification

- Access token: 15-minute expiry; delivered in HTTP response body

- Refresh token: 7-day expiry; HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Strict cookie (not accessible to JavaScript)

- Token blacklist: Redis SET with TTL matching token expiry; checked on every request

- RBAC middleware: FastAPI dependency injected per-route; roles: admin, participant, reviewer

- Resource ownership checks: participant can only access their own registration/team/submission

### 21.2 Data Encryption

- PII at rest: AES-256-GCM with per-tenant key; email, name, phone stored encrypted; hash stored for lookups

- Passwords: Argon2id (memory=64MB, parallelism=2, iterations=3) — not bcrypt

- FaceScan: no reusable face embeddings stored. Raw frames are processed transiently, deleted after validation, and represented only by validation status, score, consent timestamp, and salted audit hash.

- TLS 1.3 in transit: Nginx terminates TLS; internal services communicate over Docker network

### 21.3 Input Validation & Injection Prevention

- All API inputs validated via Pydantic v2 models with strict type enforcement

- SQL: asyncpg parameterized queries only; no raw SQL string concatenation

- File uploads: MIME type validation + magic byte check; size limit 10MB; stored outside web root

- Rate limiting: SlowAPI middleware — 100 req/min on auth endpoints, 5 req/min on OTP send

- Content Security Policy header: prevents XSS; no inline scripts in React build

### 21.4 AI Security

- Prompt injection defense: user-controlled text never interpolated directly into system prompts

- Gemini outputs parsed and validated before storage; never executed as code

- GitHub API calls use read-only token; no write permissions; rate limit handling

- AI models loaded from local disk (SentenceTransformer); no external model calls at inference time

## 22. GDPR Architecture

### 22.1 Data Minimization

- Only collect fields with explicit purpose documented; no demographic data unless explicitly needed for bias testing and consented

- FaceScan: strictly optional; purpose statement shown before camera access; no dark patterns; used only for true-person validation and never for duplicate matching

- GitHub: public data only via REST API; no OAuth required

- Phone: collected for OTP verification only; stored as hash after verification

### 22.2 Consent Management

- Registration consent checkbox: 'I agree to [Privacy Policy link]. My data will be used for: registration validation, team matching, hackathon management.' Must be unchecked by default

- Separate opt-in for: FaceScan liveness/personhood validation, with explicit statement that no cross-user face matching is performed

- Separate opt-in for: optional demographic data for bias detection improvement

- Consent timestamp stored in users.gdpr_consent_at; consent version stored

- Consent withdrawal endpoint: POST /api/v1/gdpr/withdraw-consent — stops processing; triggers erasure

### 22.3 Data Subject Rights

|Right|Endpoint|Implementation|
|---|---|---|
|Right to Access (Art. 15)|GET /api/v1/gdpr/my-data|Returns all stored data for user as JSON export|
|Right to Erasure (Art. 17)|DELETE /api/v1/gdpr/my-data|Nulls PII fields; deletes embeddings; anonymizes audit log actor_id|
|Right to Rectification (Art. 16)|PATCH /api/v1/profile/pii|Update name/college with re-validation|
|Right to Portability (Art. 20)|GET /api/v1/gdpr/export|Downloads structured JSON of all user data|
|Right to Object (Art. 21)|POST /api/v1/gdpr/object|Stops automated profiling; flags for manual review|

### 22.4 Data Retention Policy

- Active hackathon data: retained for 90 days after event close

- Evaluation scores (aggregated, anonymized): retained for 2 years for bias research

- FaceScan raw frames: deleted immediately after validation; FaceScan metadata deleted on request or 30 days after event close

- Audit logs: retained for 7 years (legal requirement for transparency claims)

- Automated purge job: Celery beat task runs nightly to delete expired data

## 23. Scalability Strategy

### 23.1 Current Architecture (3-Day Prototype)

- Single Docker Compose deployment: api + celery-worker (2 instances) + celery-beat + redis + postgres + nginx

- PostgreSQL with pgvector: handles 100,000+ embeddings with ivfflat index

- Redis job queue: handles 3-day demo bursts of 200 registrations/minute with backpressure; production path scales to 1000+/minute with more workers

- Target: 100 concurrent users, 200 registrations/minute on a single VM

### 23.2 Path to Production Scale (1000+ Concurrent Users)

1. Database: Add PostgreSQL read replica (asyncpg routes reads to replica); add PgBouncer for connection pooling

1. Celery workers: scale worker containers horizontally (10+ workers for AI tasks)

1. pgvector: Partition participant_embeddings table by hackathon_id; add HNSW index for faster ANN search

1. API: Deploy multiple FastAPI containers behind Nginx load balancer with least_conn algorithm

1. Redis: Sentinel setup for high availability; separate instances for cache vs queue vs pub-sub

1. CDN: Serve React static build from Cloudflare CDN; cache API responses for public hackathon data

1. S3-compatible storage: Move resume and pitch files to MinIO or AWS S3; keep FaceScan frames transient

### 23.3 AI Throughput Optimization

- SentenceTransformer: load model once per worker; batch encode up to 32 registrations per call

- Gemini API: async concurrent requests (max 10 parallel); circuit breaker with 30s timeout; fallback to smaller model

- pgvector ANN search: ivfflat with lists=100 for 100K embeddings; HNSW for production (no re-indexing needed)

- Embedding cache: Redis TTL-based cache for GitHub embeddings (GitHub data changes infrequently)

### 23.4 Queue Architecture

```text
Redis Lists (Celery Queues):
  registration_high:  priority queue for registration pipeline jobs (SLA: 30s)
  ai_low:             batch jobs — team formation, reviewer assignment (SLA: 5min)
  notifications:      email/WS push notifications (SLA: 60s)
  analytics:          metrics aggregation (SLA: 5min, can drop on overload)

Worker pools:
  celery-worker-high:  4 workers, consumes registration_high + ai_low
  celery-worker-notif: 2 workers, consumes notifications
```

## 24. Analytics Dashboard Design

> NOTE: This section addresses a GAP in the proposed solution. The PDF (Section 4.7) requires a real-time analytics dashboard. It is not in the proposed solution and must be built.

### 24.1 Dashboard Sections

#### Live Overview (Top Cards)

- Total Registrations | Approved | Pending Review | Flagged — with real-time WebSocket updates

- Teams Formed | Complete Teams | Incomplete Teams — progress ring chart

- Submissions Received | Evaluations Submitted | Pending — linear progress bar

- Active Bias Alerts — red badge with click-to-drill-down

#### Registration Analytics

- Registration rate over time: line chart (registrations per hour)

- Skill distribution heatmap: 10-skill radar chart for all participants aggregated

- College distribution: horizontal bar chart — top 20 colleges

- Duplicate risk distribution: histogram of duplicate_risk_score values

#### Team Formation Analytics

- Coverage score distribution: all teams — histogram

- Uncovered skills radar: which skills are most scarce across all teams

- Team size distribution: bar chart

- Auto-formed vs self-formed ratio: donut chart

#### Evaluation Analytics

- Reviewer completion rate: table per reviewer with % complete + time remaining

- Score distribution per criterion: box plot per reviewer — visual outlier detection

- Bias alert timeline: horizontal scroll list of alerts with severity and resolution status

- Fairness score gauge: 0-100 composite score updated in real-time

#### Predictive Insights Panel

- Teams at risk of not submitting: based on engagement score (logins, chat activity, submission drafts)

- Estimated final participation rate: simple logistic regression on historical patterns

- Reviewer load forecast: predicted time to completion per reviewer based on current rate

### 24.2 Implementation

- React frontend: Recharts for charts; react-query polling every 30s; WebSocket for live metrics

- Backend: GET /api/v1/analytics/{hackathon_id}/overview returns pre-aggregated metrics

- Metrics aggregated by Celery beat task every 5 minutes; stored in analytics_snapshots table

- Real-time deltas pushed via WebSocket /ws/dashboard/{hackathon_id} channel

- PDF export: backend generates executive summary PDF via pdfkit; POST /api/v1/analytics/{id}/export

- **B1/B3:** Generate Mock Data (50 participants, reviewers, submissions) and inject intentional bias patterns to demonstrate the dashboard.
- **F1/F2:** Prepare 10-minute demo script and rehearse.

### 26.2 Feature Priority Matrix

|Feature|Priority|Judging Impact|If Time Runs Out|
|---|---|---|---|
|Registration + Duplicate Detection|P0 (Must Have)|Technical 40%|Core differentiator; do not cut|
|FaceScan Personhood Validation|P0 (Must Have)|Feature + Security + UX|If camera fails, route to manual review but keep the status flow|
|Skill Vectors + Team Formation|P0 (Must Have)|Technical + Feature|Core differentiator; do not cut|
|Reviewer Assignment + Bias Detection|P0 (Must Have)|Technical + Feature|Core differentiator; do not cut|
|Hash-Chain Audit Trail|P0 (Must Have)|Technical + Feature|Simple to implement; do not cut|
|RAG Chatbot|P1 (Should Have)|Feature + Innovation|Demo with mock if RAG fails|
|Analytics Dashboard|P1 (Should Have)|Feature + UX|Simplify to 3 charts if needed|
|Promotion AI|P1 (Should Have)|Feature + Innovation|Simplify to one generated variant per channel if time-constrained|
|Appeal Workflow|P2 (Nice to Have)|Feature|Remove if time-constrained|
|Personalized Feedback NLG|P1 (Should Have)|UX + Innovation|Show Gemini output in demo|
|GDPR Consent Flow|P1 (Should Have)|Technical compliance|At minimum: unchecked consent boxes, deletion endpoint, data-use copy|

## 27. Risks and Mitigations

|Risk|Likelihood|Severity|Impact|Mitigation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Gemini API rate limits during demo (free tier: 15 req/min)|High|High|Registration pipeline stalls; chatbot unresponsive|Circuit breaker + exponential backoff; cache Gemini outputs in Redis; pre-generate all embeddings on mock data before demo|
|FaceScan scope creep into biometric matching|Medium|Critical|Regulatory risk; judge concern about ethics|Keep FaceScan limited to true-person/liveness validation; no cross-user matching; delete raw frames; implement deletion endpoint|
|SentenceTransformer model load time on first request|High|Medium|First registration takes 30+ seconds|Pre-warm model by encoding a dummy sentence on Celery worker startup; use smaller model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is 22MB)|
|pgvector ANN accuracy at small dataset size|Medium|Low|With only 50 mock users, cosine dedup less meaningful|Lower similarity threshold for demo; show similarity breakdown panel with raw numbers to judges|
|scipy Hungarian algorithm on large n|Low|Medium|Assignment takes >60s for n=200+|Run as async Celery task; return 202 immediately; WebSocket when complete|
|Blockchain-style audit adds complexity (proposed)|High|Medium|Overengineering wastes development time|MITIGATED: use hash-chain in PostgreSQL as described in this PRD — equivalent tamper-evidence at 1/10th the complexity|
|Team runs out of time on Day 2|Medium|High|Key AI features incomplete|Follow priority matrix strictly (P0 before P1); mock any AI output with realistic pre-computed data for demo|
|WebSocket connection stability on free-tier cloud|Medium|Medium|Live demo connection drops during judging|Implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff in React; have fallback HTTP polling every 5s|
|Inconsistent mock data makes AI look ineffective|Medium|High|Duplicate detection shows 0 duplicates; bias detection shows no alerts|Generate intentional duplicates (2 registrations with 85% similarity); generate intentional bias pattern (one reviewer scores 40% below average)|
|Promotion AI gets cut during polish|Medium|Medium|Feature Coverage deduction because PDF explicitly requires it|Keep a minimal generator: one prompt, four channel outputs, editable variants, mock engagement counters|
|Missing Analytics Dashboard|Already occurred|High|Feature Coverage deduction|RESOLVED: Analytics Dashboard & Predictive Insights fully detailed in Section 24|
